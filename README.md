My background in business, combined with technical expertise, allows me to bridge the gap between data and strategic decision-making.  

## What I Do  
- **Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling** – Turning raw data into actionable insights  
- **Data Analysis & Visualization** – Making complex data intuitive and impactful  
- **Business Intelligence** – Aligning data-driven solutions with real-world business challenges
